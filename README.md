# TFLite Object Detection Android App Using YOLO

A **TFLite Object Detection Android App** utilizes a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model for real-time object detection, making it lightweight and optimized for mobile devices. By integrating a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, the app achieves high-speed and accurate detection of objects directly on the device without requiring internet connectivity, ensuring both privacy and low latency.

## Key Features
1. **Efficient YOLO Integration**: YOLO models are known for their speed and accuracy, making them ideal for real-time applications.
2. **Edge Computing**: The app operates entirely on the device, avoiding network delays.
3. **Real-Time Inference**: Objects are identified and labeled in live camera feeds with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

## Steps to Build the TFLite Object Detection Android App

### **Step 1: Train and Optimize the YOLO Model**
- **Train YOLO Model**: Train the YOLO model using a dataset with labeled bounding boxes. You can use frameworks like PyTorch or Darknet to train YOLOv5 on your custom data.

- **Convert the Model to TFLite Format**:  
  Use TensorFlow's conversion tools to convert the trained YOLO model to TFLite format.

    ```bash
    python export.py --weights best.pt --include tflite
    ```

### **Step 2: Set Up the Android Project**
- Create a new project in **Android Studio** with an **Empty Activity**.
- Add TensorFlow Lite dependencies in the `build.gradle` file:

    ```gradle
    implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:2.12.0'
    implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-support:0.4.0'
    implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-metadata:0.3.0'
    ```

- Place the `model.tflite` and `labels.txt` files in the `assets` folder.

### **Step 3: Implement Real-Time Object Detection**
- **Setup CameraX** for live video streaming.
- Preprocess input frames from the camera to fit the YOLO model's expected input format (e.g., resize to 416x416).
  
    ```java
    // Example for preprocessing
    Bitmap resized = Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(inputImage, 416, 416, true);
    ```

- **Run Inference**: Pass the preprocessed image through the TensorFlow Lite model.

    ```java
    float[][][] output = new float[1][num_boxes][num_classes];
    tflite.run(inputBuffer, output);
    ```

### **Step 4: Optimize the Model**
- **Apply Quantization** to reduce the model size and speed up inference.

    ```python
    converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
    ```

### **Step 5: Display Results on the Android App**
- Once the model detects objects, draw bounding boxes around the detected objects on the camera feed.

    ```java
    // Example of drawing bounding boxes
    canvas.drawRect(left, top, right, bottom, paint);
    ```

## Applications
- **Retail**: Inventory tracking and automated checkouts.
- **Security**: Intrusion detection and surveillance.
- **Healthcare**: Medical equipment detection.
- **Autonomous Systems**: Drones and self-driving vehicles.

## Conclusion
This app demonstrates how to integrate YOLO with TensorFlow Lite to enable efficient, real-time object detection on mobile devices. By utilizing edge AI, the app provides high performance without requiring network access, making it ideal for various use cases in fields like retail, security, and autonomous systems.
